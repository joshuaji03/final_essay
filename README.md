GEOINT, short for geospatial intelligence, is a term first introduced in 2005 by a geospatial intelligence defense agency within the U.S. government. Similar to Artificial Intelligence (AI), which focuses on the mining of computational machine intelligence, GEOINT has a concentrated interest in the experiment and development of geospatial data and mapping intelligence. Some of its functionality and practical usage includes, but not limited to, "the analysis of literal imagery; geospatial data; and information technically derived from the processing, exploitation, literal, and non-literal analysis of spectral, spatial, and temporal fused products." ([learn more](https://www.omnisci.com/technical-glossary/geoint)) GEOINT also works closely with the usage of electro-optical, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and related sensor programs to aid the data collection process, which requires the collection of stationary and moving targets for the data types mentioned above.

In April 2019, ESRI announced its first release of ArcGIS Excalibur (ArcGIS Excalibur 1.0).  Although, this was not the first web-map application ESRI has created, what allowed Excalibur to stand out is its premium functionality in imagery acquisition and integration of Geospatial Intelligence concepts. Excalibur is described as the "next generation front-end web experience to search, discover, and work with imagery". ([learn more](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/excalibur/imagery/visit-the-arcgis-excalibur-team-at-the-geoint-symposium-2019/)) And just like its description, one of the major functionalities of Excalibur is that it allows ArcGIS Enterprise, ArcGIS Image Server and other ArcGIS technologies to work with national and commercial sensors for on-the-fly processing and visualization of imagery and rasters collections.

In an assigned reading that was given to us several weeks ago, it talked about a concept called **data journalism**. I think the usage of Excalibur follows closely along the guidelines of this. In laymen terms, data journalism is able to present people with a broader perspective of how one views data. Another concept that is introduced by Excalibur is **imagery project**
 

Work Flow:



On a high level, it allows users to leverage ArcGIS Enterprise to work with imagery,

For the bulk of this essay, I would be introducing

The Excalibur application is truly made for anyone's usage, well, definitely for anyone's usage in the technical field. No matter if you work in the GIS field, software development field, cloud management or work as a data analyst, imagery specialist and even just a person interested in technology. ArcGIS Excalibur may somehow still aid you in your work.

Major functionalities & Work Flow:
1. Imagery Searching
  - Given who you are or your organization, Excalibur is able to quickly filter out relating imageries through the provide criteria. A user is able to connect  directly to an imagery layer, an image service URL, or even through the **imagery catalog search**. It also allows users to serach for other areas of interest to discover and queue images for future use.
2. Working With Imagery
  - Once the users have chosen the area of interest, they will be prompted to connect to the **imagery exploitation canvas** where they can utilize a wide variety of tools to begin working with the imagery. Excalibur allows users to view imagery on top of a default basemmap, which is an orthorectified and aligned projection of the area, at the same time the exploitation canvas will enable users to view the same image in a more focused manner as it was captured in its native perspective.
3. Displaying
  - Excalibur will automatically optimise imagery to get the most value out of each image pixel. Users can also choose to change the settings under the **display tools** tab. The display tools also include functionalities like image renderers, filters, the ability to change band combinations, change image transparency/compression and even apply settings like DRA and gamma.
4. Exploitation of Tools
  - It is very easy to work with the chosen image area as well. Under the **mark up tools**, users are able to mark up, label and make measurements. There are several different options in doing this, users can choose to create simple graphics on top of their imagery by using text and shape elements to call attention. Some examples are outline, fill and transparency. The sub **measurements tool** tab allows users to measure horizontal and vertical distances, areas, and feature locations on an image.
5. Exporting
  - After users have finished all of their analysis, the finished product can be simply shared using the **export tools**. The **create presentation tool** is a shortcut that allows user to save the image to a Microsoft PowerPoint presentation, along with the metadata of the imagery.



For: Analysts, Imagery Specialists, and Imagery/GIS managers
Who: Need to discover, analyst, and report information derived from imagery analysis or exploitation
The Solution: a cloud-based application
That Provides: A simple and intuitive design to work with imagery and reference data in a project-based experience. The results are shared in dynamic information products across the organization

Image Management
- Interactive search and discovery
- Simplified access to imagery through numerous experiences
- User defined search settings to refine discovery results

Exploitation
- Tools for on-the-fly processing and dynamic visualization
- Fully integrated, side-by-side visualization of oblique and orthorectified imagery
- Image annotation and sketching with automatic, accurate transformation to geographic features

Imagery Project
- Dynamic, focused workflows to organize and accomplish image-based tasks
- Leverage existing web maps containing reference layers for contextual use in imagery project
- Streamline object collection management workflows
- Temporally analyze project layers to improve situational awareness

Imagery Derived Products
- Create products for interactive briefings
- Utilize dynamic analysis layers for use in additional platform applications
- Enable temporal monitoring of observations
- Perform traceability of analytical assessments

Personal User Settings
- System notifications to proactivity report information
- Configurable user preference settings provide the best experiences when using the application
- System administrators not required to set and manage personal preferences

How it works:
Based on who you are, run through all the different layers within the given database to present users with what imagery layers are available
