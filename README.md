GEOINT, short for geospatial intelligence, is a term first introduced in 2005 by a geospatial intelligence defense agency within the U.S. government. Similar to Artificial Intelligence (AI), which focuses on the mining of computational machine intelligence, GEOINT has a concentrated interest in the experiment and development of geospatial data and mapping intelligence. Some of its functionality and practical usage includes, but not limited to, "the analysis of literal imagery; geospatial data; and information technically derived from the processing, exploitation, literal, and non-literal analysis of spectral, spatial, and temporal fused products." ([learn more](https://www.omnisci.com/technical-glossary/geoint)) GEOINT also works closely with the usage of electro-optical, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and related sensor programs to aid the data collection process, which requires the collection of stationary and moving targets for the data types mentioned above.

In April 2019, ESRI announced its first release of ArcGIS Excalibur (ArcGIS Excalibur 1.0).  Although, this was not the first web-map application ESRI has created, what allowed Excalibur to stand out is its premium functionality in imagery acquisition and integration of Geospatial Intelligence concepts. Excalibur is described as the "next generation front-end web experience to search, discover, and work with imagery". ([learn more](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/excalibur/imagery/visit-the-arcgis-excalibur-team-at-the-geoint-symposium-2019/)) And just like its description, one of the major functionalities of Excalibur is that it allows ArcGIS Enterprise, ArcGIS Image Server and other ArcGIS technologies to work with national and commercial sensors for on-the-fly processing and visualization of imagery and rasters collections.

I think the usage of Excalibur follows closely along the guidelines of data journalism,


Work Flow:



On a high level, it allows users to leverage ArcGIS Enterprise to work with imagery,

For the bulk of this essay, I would be introducing
ArcGIS Excalibur:






Geoint: Geographic Intelligent
ArcGIS Excalibur: Web-based image exploitation workflow for timely geospatial intelligence
Metadata, data about the data
Excalibur, maps of a map

For: Analysts, Imagery Specialists, and Imagery/GIS managers
Who: Need to discover, analyst, and report information derived from imagery analysis or exploitation
The Solution: a cloud-based application
That Provides: A simple and intuitive design to work with imagery and reference data in a project-based experience. The results are shared in dynamic information products across the organization

Image Management
- Interactive search and discovery
- Simplified access to imagery through numerous experiences
- User defined search settings to refine discovery results

Exploitation
- Tools for on-the-fly processing and dynamic visualization
- Fully integrated, side-by-side visualization of oblique and orthorectified imagery
- Image annotation and sketching with automatic, accurate transformation to geographic features

Imagery Project
- Dynamic, focused workflows to organize and accomplish image-based tasks
- Leverage existing web maps containing reference layers for contextual use in imagery project
- Streamline object collection management workflows
- Temporally analyze project layers to improve situational awareness

Imagery Derived Products
- Create products for interactive briefings
- Utilize dynamic analysis layers for use in additional platform applications
- Enable temporal monitoring of observations
- Perform traceability of analytical assessments

Personal User Settings
- System notifications to proactivity report information
- Configurable user preference settings provide the best experiences when using the application
- System administrators not required to set and manage personal preferences

How it works:
Based on who you are, run through all the different layers within the given database to present users with what imagery layers are available
