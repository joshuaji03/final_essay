GEOINT, short for geospatial intelligence, is a term first introduced in 2005 by a geospatial intelligence defense agency within the U.S. government. Similar to Artificial Intelligence (AI), which focuses on the mining of computational machine intelligence, GEOINT has a concentrated interest in the experiment and development of geospatial data and mapping intelligence. Some of its functionality and practical usage includes, but not limited to, "the analysis of literal imagery; geospatial data; and information technically derived from the processing, exploitation, literal, and non-literal analysis of spectral, spatial, and temporal fused products." ([learn more](https://www.omnisci.com/technical-glossary/geoint)) GEOINT also works closely with the usage of electro-optical, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and related sensor programs to aid the data collection process, which requires the collection of stationary and moving targets for the data types mentioned above.


I want to introduce the topic of GEOINT (Geospatial Intelligent), specifically within the usage of ArcGIS Excalibur and

Geoint: Geographic Intelligent
ArcGIS Excalibur: Web-based image exploitation workflow for timely geospatial intelligence
Metadata, data about the data
Excalibur, maps of a map

For: Analysts, Imagery Specialists, and Imagery/GIS managers
Who: Need to discover, analyst, and report information derived from imagery analysis or exploitation
The Solution: a cloud-based application
That Provides: A simple and intuitive design to work with imagery and reference data in a project-based experience. The results are shared in dynamic information products across the organization

Image Management
- Interactive search and discovery
- Simplified access to imagery through numerous experiences
- User defined search settings to refine discovery results

Exploitation
- Tools for on-the-fly processing and dynamic visualization
- Fully integrated, side-by-side visualization of oblique and orthorectified imagery
- Image annotation and sketching with automatic, accurate transformation to geographic features

Imagery Project
- Dynamic, focused workflows to organize and accomplish image-based tasks
- Leverage existing web maps containing reference layers for contextual use in imagery project
- Streamline object collection management workflows
- Temporally analyze project layers to improve situational awareness

Imagery Derived Products
- Create products for interactive briefings
- Utilize dynamic analysis layers for use in additional platform applications
- Enable temporal monitoring of observations
- Perform traceability of analytical assessments

Personal User Settings
- System notifications to proactivity report information
- Configurable user preference settings provide the best experiences when using the application
- System administrators not required to set and manage personal preferences

How it works:
Based on who you are, run through all the different layers within the given database to present users with what imagery layers are available
